# Backend

[PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) v0.79 was used as a backend for easy and quick setup as it fit the need for the time being.

The collection and api rules used can be seen by importing [pb_schema.json](./pb_schema.json) in PocketBase.

[PocketBase JS-SDK](https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk) was used to integrate backend with frontend.
